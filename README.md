## Huh?
I'm still a bit salty at spotify for removing the "feature" where when you like an album, it automatically likes each song in the album and hence they appear in your liked songs.

So I made this app to like all your songs from albums that you've liked, but not liked the individual songs.

## _A word of warning_
I didn't bother making this reversable, so you should be sure you want this. For me it introduced 2k new songs to my library.
